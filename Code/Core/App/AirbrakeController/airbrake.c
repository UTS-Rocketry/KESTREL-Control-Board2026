     * With a validated drag model we can solve directly for the deployment that
     * lands on target, rather than nudging toward it with a gain and hoping.
     *
     * This is NOT open loop. The solve is redone every cycle from freshly
     * MEASURED altitude and velocity, so model error corrects itself: if Cd is
     * wrong, the real trajectory diverges from the prediction, the next cycle
     * measures where we actually are, and the new solve accounts for it. That
     * is receding-horizon feedback - the same principle as MPC - and it is why
     * no separate proportional trim term is needed here.
     *
     * (A P trim on top of this solve would be a no-op anyway: the bisection
     * converges until predicted apogee equals target, so the residual it would
     * act on is the solver's own convergence error, ~1 m, not real model error.)

     * s_target_reachable goes false when the target lies outside what the brakes
     * can do from the current state. LOG IT. On every L1410 test flight the
     * 1800 m target was below the full-brakes apogee - unreachable - and nothing
     * in the telemetry said so. Flight 3 flew 2170 m when the best achievable
     * was ~2179 m: the controller was already at the floor, and no amount of
     * gain tuning could have helped.
